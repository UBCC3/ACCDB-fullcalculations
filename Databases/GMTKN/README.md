MB08-165: Korth, M.; Grimme, S. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2009, 5 (4), 993-1003 https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ct800511q

**Notes:** General database from Grimme. Reference values are from different sources. This database superseeds the previous versions, which include GMTKN24 and GMTKN30. Some subsets are overlapping with Berkeley and with W4-17 (think W4-11, which is in Berkeley and is superseded by W4-17). Some subsets use the same geometries but have slightly different values than some Minnesota ones, due to different opinions in benchmarking techniques (for example DBH76 and ISOL24). MB08-165 is superseded by MB16-43, however it's also included here because it is still quite useful.

**IndValues.csv:** This CSV file was generated by "scraping" webpages on http://www.thch.uni-bonn.de/tc.old/downloads/GMTKN/. The webpage was scraped with a parallelized `wget`, and the result was then interpreted by the `scrape.py` script in the GMTKN55 directory to generate IndValues.csv in the same format is MGCDB84. Some values are missing from that webpage, and some are corrupted. These values are replaced with `??`. Here's the output of the script indicating which:
